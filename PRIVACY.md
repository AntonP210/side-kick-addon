# Privacy Policy — Sidekick

**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

## Data Collection

Sidekick does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## What the extension stores locally

- Your menu preferences (enabled items, display order)
- Custom site URLs you add
- UI language, translation language, and theme settings

All settings are stored locally in your browser using the browser's built-in storage API and optionally synced across your devices through your browser account. No data is sent to any external server.

## Permissions used

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `contextMenus` | Creates the right-click menu for selected text |
| `storage` | Saves your preferences locally and syncs across devices |
| `activeTab` | Reads the text you select so it can be searched on the chosen site |

## Third-party services

When you click a menu item, the selected text is passed to the chosen website (e.g. Wikipedia, Google Translate) via a URL query parameter. This is identical to manually typing into that site's search bar. Sidekick does not intercept, log, or store these queries.
